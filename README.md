# dotfiles

This is a collection of different dotfiles I'm using on my Arch Linux machine. I mainly use the repo to keep track of and sync my dotfiles, but I decided to make it public, since perhaps someone might find some of my setups useful. If so, please feel free to take and change the files to your own liking. 

There are also some other files that are not dotfiles in a strict sense, such as suckless config files and shell scripts.
