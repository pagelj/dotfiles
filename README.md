# dotfiles

This is a collection of different dotfiles I'm using on my Arch Linux machine. I mainly use the repo to keep track of and sync my dotfiles, but I decided to make it public, since perhaps someone might find some of my setups useful. If so, please feel free to take and change the files to your own liking.
